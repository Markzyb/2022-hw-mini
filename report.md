Since I used Macbook M1 chip, the environment preparation took me too much time. The original code sets the original brightness to 0, and keeps adding 1 to the brightness in the loop, until it reaches the highest lightness, which is 255. 
I mainly did two changes to the code. I set the original lightness to 255,so it reaches the highest brightness once the code starts to run; and I make the brightness "going_down" instead of "going_up". It detects the brightness, if the it is higher than the lowest brightness, the brightness keeps reducing 1, once it reaches the lowest brightness, it starts to keep adding 1. The resulting output is that the LED is blinking slowly like it is respirating.
