After running the original pwm/led_fade example, the existing code was modified to increase the increment between brightness changes after each cycle of darkest to lightness. After ten cycles of increasing speed, the increment is reset back to one and will continue to loop. The pwm divide ratio was also increased from 4 to 16 to make the change in speed more noticible to the human eye (and smartphone camera). As seen in the video taken post modification, the last few pulses are very quick and it is difficult to perceive a smooth change in brightness. At a pwm divide ratio of 4, the effect is even worse.

We used an integer between 0 and 255 as in the example, and also included the squaring of the value used for pwm to maintain linearity. It should be noted that the speed of the pulse does not increase linearly throughout the 10 pulse cycle due to the limitation of using integer values for brightness. This resolution could be increased by directly controlling the 16-bit pwm range. However, this was unnecessary for the purposes of creating this visual effect.
